# pyrubberband
A python wrapper for [rubberband](http://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/).

For now, this just provides lightweight wrappers for pitch-shifting and time-stretching.

All processing is done via the command-line through files on disk.  In the future, this could be improved
by directly wrapping the C library instead.
